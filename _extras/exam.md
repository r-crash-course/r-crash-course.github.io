## Exam

For those of you that are interested in ECTS points for this course you have the following task:
**create a program/script that shows your mastery over programming**.

Keep the following in mind:

* Create separate R project for this task. Put the important code and comments that should be judged into one .Rmd file called `exam`, that is compiled to the .html format.
* You can use any data you want, you can even analyze your own data, or the example data from some R package. Don't reuse the data used for this course.
* Follow all that you have learned during the course. Try to make the code follow good programing principles.
* Show that you can do basic data wrangling and plotting. Try asking some question and answer it with a plot created using ggplot2. Add meaningfull comments to the plots.
* Each student works on his own, and each student work should be unique. Grading is pass/no pass.

Send the **gzipped R Project** to the examiner email, make sure it **works as is**, after unpacking. In case the data you use is too big to send over email (limit of 25mb) send only the .Rmd file and .html file.

You have got **2 weeks** after the end of the course to deliver the solution.
