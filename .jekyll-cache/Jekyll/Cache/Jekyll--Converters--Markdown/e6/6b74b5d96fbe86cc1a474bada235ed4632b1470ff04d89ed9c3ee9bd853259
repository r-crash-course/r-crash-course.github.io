I"…<h2 id="exam">Exam</h2>

<p>For those of you that are interested in ECTS points for this course you have the following task:
<strong>create a program/script that shows your mastery over programming</strong>.</p>

<p>Keep the following in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create separate R project for this task. Put the important code and comments that should be judged into one .Rmd file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exam</code>, that is compiled to the .html format.</li>
  <li>You can use any data you want, you can even analyze your own data, or the example data from some R package. Donâ€™t reuse the data used for this course.</li>
  <li>Follow all that you have learned during the course. Try to make the code follow good programing principles.</li>
  <li>Show that you can do basic data wrangling and plotting. Try asking some question and answer it with a plot created using ggplot2. Add meaningfull comments to the plots.</li>
  <li>Each student works on his own, and each student work should be unique. Grading is pass/no pass.</li>
</ul>

<p>Send the <strong>gzipped R Project</strong> to the examiner email, make sure it <strong>works as is</strong>, after unpacking. In case the data you use is too big to send over email (limit of 25mb) send only the .Rmd file and .html file.</p>

<p>You have got <strong>2 weeks</strong> after the end of the course to deliver the solution.</p>
