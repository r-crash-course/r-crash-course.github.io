```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("09-")
# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", header=TRUE)
library("ggplot2")
```

Most of R's functions are vectorized, meaning that the function will
operate on all elements of a vector without needing to loop through
and act on each element one at a time. This makes writing code more
concise, easy to read, and less error prone.


```{r}
x <- 1:4
x * 2
```

The multiplication happened to each element of the vector.

We can also add two vectors together:

```{r}
y <- 6:9
x + y
```

Each element of `x` was added to its corresponding element of `y`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x:  1  2  3  4
    +  +  +  +
y:  6  7  8  9
---------------
    7  9 11 13
```

Comparison operators, logical operators, and many functions are also
vectorized:


**Comparison operators**

```{r}
x > 2
```

**Logical operators**
```{r}
a <- x > 3  # or, for clarity, a <- (x > 3)
a
```

> ## Tip: some useful functions for logical vectors
>
> `any()` will return `TRUE` if *any* element of a vector is `TRUE`
> `all()` will return `TRUE` if *all* elements of a vector are `TRUE`

Most functions also operate element-wise on vectors:

**Functions**
```{r}
x <- 1:4
log(x)
```

Vectorized operations work element-wise on matrices:

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)
m * -1
```


> ## Tip: element-wise vs. matrix multiplication
>
> Very important: the operator `*` gives you element-wise multiplication!
> To do matrix multiplication, we need to use the `%*%` operator:
>
> ```{r}
> m %*% matrix(1, nrow=4, ncol=1)
> matrix(1:4, nrow=1) %*% matrix(1:4, ncol=1)
> ```
